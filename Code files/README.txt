Project Description:

the initial file unreliable_channel.py is modified because we are coding on windows.

Attention!!!! Please Run MTPReceiver.py before running MTPSender.py !!!!

If receiver port is used please choose another port number.

The receiver's IP address is hard coded to 127.0.0.1, so it can only run on the same machine.

the count of packets left is printed out for MTPSender.py, and the receiving message is printed out for MTPReceiver.py

The output-file in this fold is in RCLF since I ran it on windows.

Both log-files are generated from running MTPSender.py and MTPReceiver.py.
